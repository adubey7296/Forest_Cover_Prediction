# Forest_Cover_Prediction
Machine Learning
## Forest-Cover-Type
* Predicting the forest cover types from remotely sensed data

## Classifier Used for Prediction
1.RandomForest Classifier

## Description
There are 13 features in the dataset, out of which Soil_type (feature) has 40 different types. So check for skewness of each feature and filter those which are not significant. Finally split the dataset into train and test and train ur model using random forest classifier and use the trained model for making predictions.
